# Hi

I am a toad who likes to code. For those wondering, I'm not actually a toad.

I finally created this repository because I care too much about myself (and it wasn't created automatically)!

Email: TheKodeToad@proton.me (I use outlook and gmail too but this is one I don't mind sharing)<br>
Pronouns: They/Them<br>
Fun Fact: I probably live on the same planet as you even if it doesn't always feel that way!

# "Pinned"

For some reason I decided to hide my contributions (so my profile doesn't hurt peoples eyes, and that's not a flex), and GitHub seems to hide these too.

Things that seem to be doing well:
- https://github.com/TheKodeToad/Numeral-Ping: nearly 100k downloads
- https://github.com/Sol-Client/Client: quite a lot of stars

Things I'm proud of:
- https://codeberg.org/TheKodeToad/jfgjds

Things I've contributed a fair bit to:
- https://github.com/PrismLauncher
- https://github.com/AxolotlClient
- https://github.com/DarkKronicle/KronHUD
- https://github.com/LoomDev/Loom
