### Hi,

I am a toad who likes to code. In case you are wondering, I'm not actually a toad.

I finally created this repository because I care too much about myself (and it wasn't created automatically)!

Email: TheKodeToad@proton.me (I use outlook and gmail too but this is one I don't mind sharing)<br>
Pronouns: They/Them
